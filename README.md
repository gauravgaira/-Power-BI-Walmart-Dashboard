# Walmart Market Business Intelligence Dashboard (walmart canada-mexico-usa Power BI)
Remark:- 📽️ I invite you to kindly watch the demo video link showcasing the dashboard in action. It highlights the interactive features and demonstrates how data storytelling effectively translates complex data into actionable business insights.

🚀 Excited to showcase my latest end-to-end Business Intelligence project using Power BI, where I built a dynamic and insight-driven dashboard for Walmart Market, a multinational retail giant operating in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

🔍 Project Objectives:
1. Track and compare Total Transactions, Total Profit, Total Returns, and Revenue vs Targets
2. Understand geographic performance down to store city level
3. Identify high-performing product brands and return trends
4. Use previous month as a benchmark for evaluating current month results

💡 Key Features Implemented in Power BI:

🔹 Matrix Visual:

Displays Total Transactions, Profit, Profit Margin, and Return Rate by Product Brand
Applied Data Bars on Transactions and Color Scales on Profit Margin (White to Green) and Return Rate (White to Red)
Top 30 Brands visualized using Top N filter and sorted by performance

🔹 KPI Cards:

Current Month Transactions vs Last Month
Current Month Profit vs Last Month
Current Month Returns vs Last Month (with “Low is Good” formatting)

🔹 Interactive Map & Treemap:

Map shows Total Transactions by Store City with slicer for country (USA, Mexico, Canada)
Treemap enables drill-down from Country → State → City for deep regional insights

🔹 Weekly Revenue Trend:

Column chart filtered to show only 1998 data
Tracks revenue weekly for precise time-series performance monitoring

🔹 Revenue vs Target Gauge:

Visualizes current month revenue against previous month’s target
Focuses on latest period performance, ideal for executive summary views

🔹 Bookmarks & Interactions:

Created bookmark for “📍 Portland hits 1,000 sales in December”
Configured button navigation and page-level notes
Disabled unwanted interactions between visuals for better user experience

📈 Top Insights Uncovered:-

✅ Portland reached 1,000+ sales in December — high-performing city

🏆 Top 10 Product Brands account for 25% of total revenue and exceed revenue targets

📊 Current Month Transactions & Profit improved over last month — but Returns increased by 2.9%, signaling product or service issues

🌎 Mexico's Market outperformed the previous month in both Profit and Revenue — deserves increased focus and investment

🛠️ Tools & Skills Applied:
Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Conditional Formatting | Drill-Down | Slicers | Bookmarks | Storytelling

This project helped me refine my ability to translate raw data into business strategy, align visuals with executive decision-making, and simulate real-time market reporting.
